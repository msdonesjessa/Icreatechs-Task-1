Though I already have knowledge regarding HTML and CSS, I cannot change the fact that this task has awakened me to fully understand the foundations of HTML and its key elements. I successfully created the basic HTML structure, incorporating the necessary declarations in the html>, <head>, and <body> elements. I titled the page and added a heading and a paragraph to the body. Additionally, I created both an ordered list and an unordered list, each containing three distinct items. Furthermore, I inserted an image with an appropriate alt attribute and linked an anchor element to an external website.
